Give me a plan. now i add two more files in the eval dir, theyâ–Œare sam2_video/eval/inference.py and sam2_video/eval/eval.py,
please fully understand the funtion with the same name with the
files, know about the meaning of the parameters. After i finish
the training process in train.py , i need to use these two
functions to calculate the evaluation metric. The process will be
like followin: 1. use the modelCheckpoint.best_model_path, to get
the best mode (the SAM2Base)'s state dict, then load the  state
dict into the sam2 video predictor. Then do the inference to get
the predict.json. Afte that, call the eval function to get the
eval.pkl, then aggregate the results from the eval.pkl and save
the final metrics with wandb. Please integrate the above pipeline within the train.py and add the corresponding config into the hydra config system. Give me a plan as start.
